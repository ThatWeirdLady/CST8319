 Challenges
Integration into Team and Product:

Cultural Fit: Ensuring that the hired individuals align with the team's culture and values can be challenging, affecting collaboration and teamwork.

Understanding Product Vision: Bridging the gap between external hires and the product's vision, ensuring that they fully comprehend the game's objectives and design.Game Development:

Technical Compatibility: Verifying that the skills and technical expertise of the hired individuals align with the specific requirements of the game development process.

Codebase Familiarity: Integrating external developers into an existing codebase can be challenging, requiring time and effort to familiarize them with the project's structure and conventions.

Communication and Coordination: Coordinating development efforts between in-house and external developers, potentially across different time zones and communication platforms.Project Progress and Timelines:

 Adhering to Schedules: Ensuring that external developers adhere to project timelines and deadlines to prevent delays in the game's development.

  
Quality Control: Maintaining the expected quality and standards of the game, as external hires might not be as invested or knowledgeable about the product's intricacies.Determining Challenges:To assess these challenges, we would:

Conduct thorough interviews and technical assessments to gauge the cultural fit, technical skills, and understanding of the project vision.

Evaluate past projects and experiences of potential external hires to ensure their capabilities align with the game's requirements.

Set clear expectations and communication channels to establish a collaborative working environment and mitigate integration challenges.

Monitor progress and quality through regular check-ins, code reviews, and feedback loops to ensure alignment with project timelines and objectives.

Maintain open communication with both internal and external team members to address challenges promptly and ensure a successful collaboration throughout the project.

  Appendix : Who does what.
You will need to provide the following items as part of your preliminary investigation report:1.
 
Xihua - Report of the current system implementation and how you will go about determining this.2.
 
Jingfei - A clear outline of user requirements and the process used to determine user requirements.3.
 
Renee - Outline potential costs associated with taking on this project (Consider opportunity cost). Outline the tools you might use to determine this (Hint: Sprint burndown charts). 4.
 
Jian - An outline of challenges associated with hiring outside help. Once again, outline how you would determine this. (Consider integration into team and product). 5.

 Potential costs
When looking at potential costs, there are two ways of looking at it. The first one is the cost of money. We need to consider the price of letting go of a project compared to the price of hiring someone from the exterior. Also, when analyzing hiring someone from the exterior, we can also compare the value of the new game, solitaire, that we are making. We do not have actual amounts at this point as an analysis of prices still needs to be 
done. The opportunity would be that if we could manage to have this game made as well as keeping the current projects, we would have more money at the end. The second factor that we need to consider is time. The fact is that we do not have enough time to complete the remaining projects and to add a new one. We only have 11weeks left to complete the solitaire game. If we hire someone from the exterior, we will have more time to complete our current games but the money cost would go up
